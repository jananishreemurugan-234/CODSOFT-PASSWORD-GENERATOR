# CODSOFT-PASSWORD-GENERATOR

## Project Overview
The Codsoft Password Generator is a secure and customizable desktop tool developed using Python and Tkinter.
It allows users to create strong, random passwords with user-defined length and complexity. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, the application helps reduce the risks associated with weak or repetitive passwords.

This project was developed as part of the Codsoft Internship (Python Programming). The focus is on providing a real-world solution to password management while applying concepts like GUI programming, cryptographic randomization, and file handling.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to design a practical, secure, and attractive GUI-based application. The tool not only generates secure passwords but also provides a visually appealing user interface to enhance user experience.

## Features
- Select password length.
- Generate multiple passwords at once.
- Options to include/exclude lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.
- Option to avoid ambiguous characters like I, l, 1, O, 0.
- Display generated passwords in a text box.
- Save generated results to a .txt file.
- Modern colorful UI with attractive button styling.

## User Interface & Color Theme
One of the highlights of this project is the custom GUI design. Instead of keeping the default Tkinter gray layout, a bright and modern theme was applied to make the app more engaging.
- Background Color → A soft purple (#b008fe) that gives the application a fresh look.
- Buttons → Generate Passwords button is bright pink (##fb58af) with white text.
- Save to File button matches the same style for consistency.
- Checkbuttons → White background with black labels for readability.
- Text Box → White background with black monospace font for better visibility of generated passwords.

This vibrant design makes the tool look professional, fun, and user-friendly while improving usability.

## How It Works
1. Enter the password length (e.g., 12).
2. Enter the number of passwords to generate (e.g., 5).
3. Choose the desired options from the checkboxes.
4. Click Generate Passwords → Secure passwords appear instantly in the text box.
5. Click Save to File → Save them into a .txt file for later use.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.13.7 on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   python password_generator.py
4. The GUI will open with the colorful interface.

## Conclusion
- The Codsoft Password Generator Application demonstrates how security and design can be combined in Python projects. By using the secrets module for randomization and Tkinter for GUI, it creates a strong yet simple solution for generating secure passwords.
- The color theme (purple background, pink buttons, white text box) not only makes the tool visually appealing but also enhances user experience compared to a plain design.
- This project proves that user interface design matters as much as functionality. By giving the application an attractive look, users are encouraged to use it regularly, thereby improving their password habits.
- Future improvements could include a copy-to-clipboard button, a password strength meter, or even an online version. With its balance of practicality, security, and design, this project stands as a solid example of a professional internship task.
